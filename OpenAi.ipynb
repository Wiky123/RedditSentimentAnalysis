was not applicable for the jury selection stage (i.e. day 1 of showing up for jury duty).**  for future people\\'s benefit, here\\'s what i learned:\\n\\n1) what can you bring to the first day of in-person jury duty?  yes, you can bring your phone, laptop, and even food and drink to the court house in mineola!  you will go through a metal detector on the way in, but other than dangerous items, everything else is okay.  *you are not yet going into a trial on this first day, so the rules are very lenient at this stage.*\\n\\n2) tip:  bring a laptop, snacks and coffee/tea in a travel mug if you like.   you can be productive while you wait around. there was even wifi (no password needed) that you could use and seemed to function reasonably well.\\n\\n3) there is a juror\\'s \"lounge\" attached to the auditorium-like room where you are first seated.  there are larger chairs and some desks there, which are useful if you want to get some work done.  there are bathrooms and a vending machine, too.  a speaker will call out names, so you don\\'t need to be in the auditorium to hear if your name is called for potential jury selection (see #6 and #7 for how that works). \\n\\n4) will i get to eat lunch at jury duty?  you\\'ll get 90 minutes for lunch (from 12:30 to 2pm) and you are encouraged to leave the building.  there is no food service or cafeteria in the building in mineola.  apparently the cafeteria was closed, but never re-opened, after covid in 2020.  \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* *i wish i knew about the 90-minute break in advance! \\\\*\\\\*\\\\**  if you live nearby, that\\'s enough time to go home and walk your dog or take care of other business (quickly) and come back.  or more time to get some work done.  make sure you allow enough time for parking and possible traffic on the way back. *note: you can bring lunch with you into the court house if you don\\'t want to buy lunch outside somewhere.*  they had no problem with the food in my work bag (just snacks in my case).  and you can eat in the juror\\'s lounge (see #3) if you like.\\n\\n5) clothing:  *everything i read said business-casual was required, no jeans allowed, etc.*  *however, there was no obvious dress code requirement for this early stage!*  this is not true jury duty, it is more like pre-jury-duty.  you are waiting around to be potentially picked for a jury trial.  i\\'m sure business attire is required for an trial, but most people showed up in regular street clothes.  it was january, so i didn\\'t see any shorts or flip flops, but there were plenty of people wearing jeans, sneakers, sweatshirts, etc.  nobody said anything about it.  again, things will be different if you come back as an actual juror for a trial.\\n\\n6) what to expect:  you will go into an auditorium-like room around 8:45am (or earlier if you arrive early).  you\\'ll watch a film about jury duty responsibilities (around 8:45am), fill out an anonomous survey card (gender, race, ethnicity, age, etc), and receive additional information from an actual person.  *\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* they will take one part of your jury duty notice that you got by mail.  don\\'t forget to bring it with you! it\\'s evidence that you showed up.  it will also go into their lottery-like selection process for choosing potential jurors.  \\\\*\\\\*\\\\**  after these preliminaries, you\\'ll sit around waiting to potentially be called into a side room for potential jury selection (they will call names over the loud speaker).  it\\'s a lottery system, so whether you get called into a side room (and potentially evaluated to serve on a jury) has nothing to do with your initial jury duty number (e.g. a1111).  that number only related to whether you have to show up on a given day.  i was given a week (monday-friday) where i had to call in each day.  i was finally chosen to go to the court house on thursday.\\n\\n7) jury selection:  if your name is called, you\\'ll be sent to a numbered room with about two-dozen people.  in this room, lawyers for the prosecution and defense will provide basic information about the type of case you might serve on.  they will then ask questions of the first batch of people (again chosen by lottery) while everyone else sits around and listens.  if you are not selected while in this room, and it is early in the day, you are \"recycled\" back into the auditorium and could get called a second time to be evaluated for a different case (based on lottery).\\n\\nmy outcome: i got a couple of hours of work done in the morning, ate snacks, etc, then i was called into one of the jury selection rooms around 11:15am.  there was then a lunch break at 12:30 and i returned at 2pm to the same numbered room.  i did not end up being questioned at all.   the lawyers filled the required number of jurors before i was called (just luck).  at this point, it was late enough in the day that they declared all the unchosen people to be done with their service.  i got to go home.  *others ended up on various trials, which can be short (a day or two) or really long (many weeks).*\\n\\ni hope that helps others who get the notification in the mail and are wondering about the logistics!',

have yet to be id‚Äôd. the gilgo 4 were all dumped in the marsh wrapped in duck camo  burlap sacks. \\n\\ni don‚Äôt see rex as a torso killer personally. he seems to be very calculated, organized,  cunning, neat with victims & obviously intelligent when it came to the abductions (leaving victims without cellphones, picking them up personally, etc.). \\n\\nthe dismembered bodies seem to have met a completely different demise. i wouldn‚Äôt understand how people could come to the conclusion that heuermann is responsible for all of them. \\n\\nkey to this point is the fact that the earliest victims were from the 90‚Äôs (& dismembered), at least 15 yrs before any of heuermann‚Äôs known victims. i find it hard to believe that he began killing by dismembering torsos. \\n\\ninstead, i think the og ‚Äúlong island serial killer‚Äù (from the 90‚Äôs) got angry when rex‚Äôs victims were discovered. so he dropped more body parts all along suffolk and nassau counties until they were discovered

court, grandparent rights dv/ suffolk county east islip not sure where to start but i need help badly and really cant afford to pay a lawyer at this very moment but this is becoming time sensitive. my fiance and i fled my parents house when it got to the point i was worried about our safety. my father was so extremely abusive to my mother and i growing up until i was about 14 and big enough to fight back and stop it and now he is drinking and just as bad verbally mentally and attacked me 3 times over the year we lived there, once while holding my infant daughter (which i had my phone recording in hand) he\\'s an animal and is never held accountable for anything all growing up the cops would show up and just leave or tell him to sleep somewhere else for the night. while my memories of my childhood are of my mother begging for her life cuz he was going to shoot and kill her or getting locked in my room so i couldn\\'t interfere while he beat her up more time then i can remember. \\n\\n\\nthe short story:\\nwe moved in when my daughter was born 1 1/2 yrs later fled early in the morning with just a small bag to live in a hotel till we could find a place. \\nthey went right to the courts the moment we fled and filed for \"grandparent rights\" \\nwe got a court appointed lawyer who no matter how much we reached out had no time to help or listen and only spoke to 5 minutes before some of the hearings and we we\\'re told if we didn\\'t offer them some time to see my daughter, the judge absolutely will. also, if we went to trial it would probably be more then what they we\\'re telling us to offer (2 hours 1x per month). 1 stipulation we made was that it always be in a public place that we choose so wed never have to go to there house and put ourself in harms way again. our understanding now is that they\\'d have to prove they had a substantial relationship with her and that it was in her best interest they stay in her life. however we we\\'re also told there is nothing to stop them from going to the court after a year or 2 and requesting more time with her this is where the time sensitive part comes into play the more they see her the harder it would be to end this. she was a year and a half old when we left how much of a relationship could they have built with basically an infant and they\\'ve only seen her 5 times since we left, each time for 2 hrs at a park and she is now 3 1/2.\\n\\n\\nwhat i want now:\\nnow that our lives are back in order i want to go back to court and get this agreement thrown out and my side be heard of how i grew up so the courts would see they should not have any rights to see her and that should be up to us, her parents who she see\\'s. they are always arguing in the house, they always make racial remarks about every race and think its a big joke just as they did around me growing up. they didnt respect anything i asked of them such as my not even 1 yr old being put in front of the t.v. or my daughter being in the backyard at all unless i was there since they refused to put up anything around there in ground pool (since it wouldn\\'t look nice) until way after we left and my sisters 1 yr old walked onto the cover and almost died and my father had to save her and wound up needing surgery on his leg and knee from that. they are irresponsible, only care about how nice there house looks and have no understanding of how to act around or look after a toddler. there\\'s many more examples. \\n\\n\\nour situation at the time:\\nwe decided to move there temporarily when my daughter was born (wishful thinking, things would be different) once things started getting really bad we no longer wanted to stay there and had more then enough money to get our own place but it was very difficult getting it done quick enough in the middle of the pandemic. our situation was so bad that it made more sense to stay in a hotel temporarily until we found a place. at the time i had no idea about how family court works all i was threatened with was \"what do you think, they\\'ll side with you and let that baby stay in a motel while she has a nice house, her own bedroom and backyard to play in and if you leave we\\'ll spend everything we have to, on a lawyer and we\\'ll file for grandparent rights, we\\'ll have that baby every weekend\" which in turn since i was scared that was possible (at the time) stayed at the hyatt with a seperate room in it so they cant say she doesnt have a room (i know now i basically could\\'ve stayed on the street as long as she was taken care of eating and healthy) i was so depressed, beaten down and hopeless i was scared that could happen as i didnt also have money for a lawyer as well. i didnt forsee that they would withhold all of our things clothes, toys, computer, etc. all we left with that morning was her stroller and her diaper bag filled with clothes cuz i didnt want them knowing i was leaving and get into a fight. so since they would not let us get anything we owned i was then forced to spend a lot more money on clothes for 3 of us, toys so my daughter wouldnt miss her things she was used to having especially at night (had to find and buy the same things we owned) so after a month at the hyatt and $9,000 later we we\\'re now unable to get an apartment and eventually had no choice but to turn to dss for help which eventually lead to a homelss shelter and after 6 months of family court they we\\'re forced to give all of our stuff back.\\n\\n\\nlast bit:\\nthere\\'s a bunch more to this but i just want this to end, i shouldn\\'t be forced to bring my child to see her grandparents every month for the next 18 yrs my child was just born and things are being decided for her already, this doesn\\'t make sense.\\n i don\\'t want to be forced to see them every month, they have no reason to treat us any different or change how they are and i\\'m scared to even be around my father as he has threatened me in the past he\\'ll make shit up if he has to (basically if push comes to shove, or if i stand up to them, i\\'m going to lose) i\\'m worried being around him he can try fighting me and then say i started it which is why i\\'ll never go to there house again but still i shouldn\\'t have to worry every month of what could happen and i will not let them take my daughter cuz they can\\'t be trusted. i\\'m tired of feeling like this i\\'m in my 30\\'s and it takes a toll on me and my fiance this has become a living nightmare i\\'ll never be able to get away from them.\\nalso her other grandparents see her all the time and
